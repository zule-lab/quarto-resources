There are various sources of remote sensing data across Canada. A lot of this data is available in Google Earth Engine ([more datasets here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets)), which is often a great option for processing this type of data. Some of the most useful sources for the ZULE Lab are listed below:
