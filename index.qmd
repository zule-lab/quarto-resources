Template literature base using `quarto`.

It is structured as a website since quarto books require the chapters
to be explicitly listed in the `_quarto.yml` which doesn't gel super 
well with this type of quickly growing literature base. Each file
represents a paper, or a topic, or a book, and listing each as a chapter
is too cumbersome. 

Listing pages are used to show all the pages within the subdirectories,
easily searched or sorted. 


## Usage

1. Fork/copy/get repo
1. Remove example tree documents
1. Replace with your own documents 
1. Adjust listing pages relevant to your subdirectory structure
1. Adjust `_quarto.yml`
