    "text": "Version 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\nCopyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n<program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands show w and show c should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>."

    "text": "Lab Code of Conduct and Policies\nCode of conduct adapted from our colleague Dr. Christie Bahlai, Kent State University\nScience is hard, and the work of making sure science isn’t harder than it needs to be is on all of us. We create our culture, and in the Ziter lab, our culture is inclusive.\nWe value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every lab member and collaborator has a positive, educational experience unhindered by unnecessary challenges caused by non-inclusive behaviour. Accordingly, everyone who participates in any Ziter Lab project is expected to show respect and courtesy to other community members at all times, and recognize that you are an ambassador for our lab and institution when interacting with collaborators, community partners, or other stakeholders/rightsholders.\nCarly Ziter, as head of the Ziter Lab, and all lab members, are dedicated to a harassment and discrimination-free experience for everyone. Discrimination or harassment based on racial or ethnic background, citizenship status, religion (or lack thereof), political affiliation, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, dis/ability status, appearance or body size will not be tolerated. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination by (and/or of) members of our community in any form.\nTo make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct. - All lab communication - online and in person - should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual or discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate at any time. - Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other contributors. - Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate. - Please make an effort to make an inclusive environment for everyone. Give everyone a chance to talk and an opportunity to contribute. - Watch out for microaggressions. Be aware that your actions can be hurtful to others or contribute to a negative environment even if you had no intent of harm. Listen. Offer a genuine apology. Commit to learning and doing better.\nUnacceptable behaviour includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion (or lack thereof), sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of discussions, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing or discriminatory behaviour are expected to comply immediately.\nMembers of the community who violate these rules - no matter how much they have contributed to the Ziter lab, or how specialised their skill set - will be approached by Carly Ziter.\nTo report an issue please contact Carly Ziter. All communication will be treated as confidential.\nAdditional Lab Policies Flexible working hours For post-graduate members of the lab (grad students and PDFs), the specific hours that you choose to work are up to you. Some people find they work best on certain tasks early in the morning, or late at night. Some members prefer to work part time from a coffee shop or home. This flexibility is a major perk of academia, and it is the policy of the Ziter Lab that every member is already self-motivated and doesn’t necessarily need to work a traditional 9 to 5 day from the lab in order to meet their goals. However, ideally, all lab members will have at least a few hours most days to overlap with Carly and/or other lab members in order to stay in touch on any challenges or successes, and contribute to the intellectual and social culture of the lab.\nUndergraduate research assistants should check in with Carly as well as their direct graduate or postdoc advisor about work hours (see the undergrad orientation document in Google Drive). Some project positions will require specific hours, while others are more flexible. Undergraduates in the lab are encouraged to attend lab meetings and participate in the broader activities of the lab.\nAll lab members are expected to participate in scheduled lab meetings when possible. If you anticipate working particularly unusual hours (regularly, or during a specific period), please touch base with Carly so that we’re on the same page.\nAlong these lines, we are each welcome to send work-related emails over the weekend or late at night, but no lab members are required to reply to them outside of their typical work hours (even if the email is from Carly – who tends to send late night emails!)\nVacation Scheduled time off and vacations are important for personal health, well-being, and workplace productivity. Note that Concordia does not yet have an official policy on vacation leave for graduate students. As such, please consider this McGill policy for graduate student vacation as a rough guide if you are unsure what is appropriate, or, talk to Carly: > “Graduate students and postdocs should normally be entitled to vacation leave equivalent to university holidays and an additional total of fifteen (15) working days in the year.” Short vacations (e.g. a few days) do not need to be cleared with Carly in advance, although I do appreciate knowing when you are away. For vacations of a longer period (e.g. a week or more), the timing should ideally be discussed with Carly in advance so that we can ensure that your absence doesn’t compromise planned research, lab, or classroom activities, and we can find someone to step in and cover your responsibilities if necessary.\nCarly’s personal and professional travel will be written on the lab whiteboard so all lab members can reference when she is out of town. If you are comfortable, I encourage you to do the same. This allows your lab-mates to know when you are likely to be unavailable for collaboration or support, and is useful for planning lab activities.\nUndergraduate students should discuss vacations with Carly directly."

    "text": "Lab Individual Mentoring Plan\nInspired by the Duffy lab at University of Michigan\nThis is meant to be a living document – which means that we will continue to discuss this as a lab, and collectively update it as needed. We (you and Carly) will aim to meet formally ~ once per semester (and at least once per year) to reflect on challenges and successes, and update the relevant sections\n1. A brief summary of what the mentor will provide to the student (e.g. your expectations of me!) As your advisor, it is my job to help you ensure that you are staying on track and meeting your goals as best as possible throughout your program. You can think of my role as a coach. I will not micro-manage your schedule or your thesis research project, but will do my best to ensure that you have the appropriate resources and connections to develop as a scientist. A single mentor will rarely meet all of the needs of any given student (and I encourage you to seek out mentorship outside of the lab, including peer mentorship), but you can expect the following from me as your advisor: - Regular one-on-one meetings to discuss your progress, including a formal meeting each semester to discuss and update the relevant components of this mentoring plan (e.g., goals, milestones, etc.) - Guidance on key components of the research process (developing strong scientific questions, experimental design, analysis, and writing) and professional development - Funding and resources necessary to complete your research - An open door to discuss any pressing issues or concerns related to your professional progress, navigating grad school, or life at Concordia\n2. Goals (short, medium, long term) These are “big picture” items that you want to achieve in the short, medium, and long term. For example, “learn analysis X”, “publish a paper”, “get a government job”, “do a PhD”. It is totally ok if your goals change over time as you progress through your degree (that’s why we will revisit this plan regularly!)\n3. Milestones These are more concrete steps towards achieving your goals. For example, things like “attend QCBS R workshops this semester”, “plan a fieldwork protocol”, or “circulate a chapter draft to co-authors”. These are things that you could schedule, or have a set timeline.\n4. Plan of attack Think about this as the daily/weekly schedule that will move you towards hitting your milestones and achieving your goals. For example, in your first semester your plan may include reading the literature, working on a funding proposal, and taking classes. In your later semesters, your plan may include things like finishing data analysis, drafting a paper, or preparing a conference presentation.\n5. Publication plans An MSc degree typically includes 1-2 papers based on work that you did. A PhD degree typically includes 3-4 (and the lower numbers for both of these are totally great!). Typically, you will be the first author on papers in your dissertation. Carly will help with design, analysis, and writing, and will be a co-author. Other co-authors (e.g. co-supervisors, committee members, other students or colleagues) will be discussed as warranted. This section will evolve as you move throughout your degree (e.g. we will outline specific papers and target journals based on your research). For an MSc degree, I expect a solid draft of one paper by graduation (but you may or may not have a paper submitted or published yet). For a PhD degree, it is best to publish as you go; ideally, you will have one or more papers submitted by the time you defend your thesis.\n6. Professional meetings or workshops Here, we will discuss any conferences, workshops, or special courses you may want to attend in the upcoming semester/year.\n7. Funding Funding: In this section, we will discuss funding for your stipend, your research costs, and travel for each semester/year, as well as any upcoming grants or fellowships you may be eligible to apply to. It’s ok to ask about money - you should always know where your funding is coming from!\n8. Courses Which courses are you taking? Which are you considering?\n9. Plans for meeting and communication This is an opportunity to touch base about how frequently we want to meet (as well as any needed meetings with key collaborators or co-advisors). We will start with ~ bi-weekly meetings, but this can shift over time, as you settle into your project and have a better idea of your needs. There may be periods we meet infrequently (e.g., when you are in the field, or working on lab analysis or identification for stretches of time), and periods we meet more frequently (e.g., during intensive analysis or writing periods where you need more feedback). We will also discuss how to best get in touch for different purposes.\n10. Data, code, and documentation To be written! This is a good topic for a future lab meeting…"

    "section": "",
    "text": "*Note: if you're an undergrad, please see this orientation doc instead\n\nHi there, welcome to the team!\n\nThis short guide is to get you started in the Ziter Urban Landscape Ecology (ZULE) Lab. We designed this \"online orientation\" during Covid (while we were all working from home), but have found it useful to maintain this online guide to keep everything in one place, even though we're now back in the lab. So, please read through this guide carefully as your online orientation to the lab (to be followed by in person meetings when you officially join us, including a time to work through your mentoring plan with Carly).\nOur physical lab space is in the SP building on Loyola Campus, in room 432.03. For graduate students/PDFs, you will need to request a key, which you can do using this form: https://www.concordia.ca/offices/facilities/key-request-info/key-request-form.html (it will take a few weeks for keys to come in). \nSince we've been back and forth between home and the lab for the last few years, our lab also does a lot of communication using online tools that you may or may not be familiar with. In the lab, we often use:\n\nThe Lab Google Drive (where we keep important lab documents, and works in progress): This space includes a general lab folder, as well as sub-folders for specific projects. Right now, you have full access to the lab google drive and the documents in it. I ask that you please do not modify or delete any files that you have not been asked to work on specifically!\n\nThe lab drive is probably due for a \"clean up\" this summer, so things may shift around a little!\nWe are working on transitioning some of our lab materials away from google drive and onto the lab GitHub, so you may be working there (particularly if you are working with data-based projects with graduate students). Depending on your projects, there may be additional shared workspaces with collaborators outside the lab.\n\nZoom (although we're mostly back to \"in person\" mode, we sometimes use zoom for \"face to face\" meetings when folks can't be on campus. You are probably familiar with Zoom already…).\n\n\n\n\nZulip(our lab \"organizational platform\"). This works a lot like slack, if you've used that before. The lab Zulip workspace is a place we can share links to papers or resources, ask quick questions about projects, discuss daily or weekly tasks, share funny memes, send messages to each other, etc. Think of this as the socially-distant equivalent of asking someone a question in the lab, or popping by my office to talk about something. It's a little more casual and flexible than email, and keeps all of our lab conversations organized in one place so that we can revisit them later.  (You should have received an invitation by email to join the lab Zulip, and we often do a little \"tour\" during lab meetings at the beginning of new semesters, as well)\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Calendar: You will receive an invite to the lab calendar, where you can see any team meetings scheduled (by me, or graduate students in the lab), as well as our weekly group lab meeting. You can also view Carly's calendar, where you can check when I am busy with another meeting or scheduled task. Note that while I am still not travelling as much as I usually would, there may be days or weeks that I am at a virtual meeting or conference and will be less available, or that are reserved for course prep and teaching. I try and keep this updated, but note that it's occasionally wrong (it doesn't always merge properly with my outlook calendar) \n\n\n\n\nEmail: You can still contact me or others in the lab via email (although Zulip will be used for most day-to-day lab conversation)\n\n\nIf you ever need to contact me quickly (e.g., in an emergency) you can reach me on my cell\nNote: for those of you who are co-supervised, we may be using different platforms, or different ways of managing your research. We will sort this out with your supervisory team as we go! \n\nThis rest of this document is to answer some basic questions about the lab, your jobs, and who to talk to/where to look if you have questions about what to do next.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge up front that this year might be a little weird (again)! Just like it's changed all of our day to day lives and your studies, COVID-19 has also changed the process and pace of doing research. Even though we're slowly transitioning back to \"normal\" research in the lab, it's still possible that sometimes field projects (or parts of field projects) may shift to more remote work, projects may get off to a slower start than usual, or we may have to shift directions a few times throughout the summer as we understand what is and isn't going to be possible. Things may look a little different from what we've originally discussed, and Concordia may also introduce new regulations about the kinds of work you can do, or where you can work from (especially related to fieldwork). That's all ok! Our goals are always to move lab projects forward, while making sure that you all have meaningful research/learning experiences (and get a paycheck, or course credits!). Thanks in advance to you all for being flexible and open minded as we work together.\n\n\nBefore we go any further, a few ground rules:\n\nThe Ziter lab has a lab code of conduct, available here Please read through this document to familiarize yourself with our lab values and expectations for each other. \n\n\nSome FAQ for working in the ZULE lab:\nWhat do I need to do to \"officially\" get started?\n\nYou should all have filled out paperwork (or be in the process of filling out paperwork) with Carly and/or Concordia to be properly registered in your degree, placement, etc. If you encounter any problems with your course registration, pay check, etc., contact Carly so that we can sort this out (Note: if you are enrolled in a department other than biology, we will likely need to work with your advisor in your home department to sort this kind of stuff out)\nUseful contacts:\n\nKelly Pingal is our graduate program assistant, and can help with issues related to registration, courses, etc. for grad students: biograd.fas@concordia.ca\nNiyusha Samedi is our Postdoctoral Development Coordinator and can help with issues related to PDFs: niyusha.samadi@concordia.ca\n\n\nWhat happens in lab meeting?\n\nEach week during the academic term (Sept - May), we have a lab meeting with the full team (and sometimes some guests from other labs). We will schedule a time for these meetings as the fall approaches. At lab meeting, we usually do a quick check in to see how everyone is doing, and discuss any issues or announcements. Then, we'll all discuss a paper we've read, or a talk that we've watched, or discuss a professional development topic (like science communication, how to read a paper, best practices for data entry or analysis, etc.). We will decide the topics in advance together. All lab members are expected to lead at least one lab meeting each semester. \nFor co-supervised students, we can discuss the expectations for attending lab meeting with your co-advisors. This may fluctuate from semester to semester, but I prefer that you attend lab meeting at least a few times per semester, so that you can keep in touch with your labmates and keep us informed of your work. However, please don’t feel obligated to attend every week if you are busy with your other lab commitments. \n\nWhen, and how much, should I work?\n\nSee the lab code of conduct for more info on flexible working hours, vacation, etc. I also realize that with COVID-19 and most of us working from home (and sometimes from different time zones), work hours may be unusual. This is ok, but please do try and make time to check in with your peers and labmates regularly. This will help reduce feelings of isolation, and is an important support as you complete your work. \n\nWhat if I get sick?\n\nIf you're feeling sick, please take a sick day(s). You can always make up the work later, and your wellbeing (and the wellbeing of your labmates!) is a priority. This is always true, but particularly so during the current situation, where we should all be taking very good care of our health. If you anticipate needing extended time off, please let someone in the lab know that you're unwell, so that we don't worry about you, and can make sure that someone else steps in to cover any important tasks if needed. \n\n\n\nSimilarly, if you have a family emergency, or a similar issue, please take the time you need to deal with it (and let Carly or a labmate know that you need some time away from work). \n\n\nI need something to be able to do my work well\n\nIf you need resources (more storage space on your computer, access to a book or article, etc.) to be able to work effectively, please talk to Carly. We can likely arrange something through the lab. \n\nOk, that's all for now! There will be more updates to come as we all settle into the semester. \nWelcome to the team, and looking forward to a fun year!"

Thanks in advance to you all for being flexible and open minded as we work together this summer!\nBefore we go any further, a few ground rules: The Ziter lab has a lab code of conduct. Please read through this document fully to familiarize yourself with our lab values and expectations for each other.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost students in the lab call me Carly, and you are welcome to do the same. Some students are uncomfortable with this, and prefer to call me Dr Ziter, Dr Z, Professor, Prof… those are all fine, too.\n\n\n\n\nYou should all have filled out paperwork (or be in the process of filling out paperwork) with Carly and/or Concordia to understand the terms of your work, and make sure you get paid properly, or are receiving appropriate course credit. This means filling out any paperwork related to CUSRA, NSERC, MITACS (or other) awards, or filling out a TRAC NOH form, or registering for the appropriate SCOL/BIOL/LOYC credits. If you aren’t sure if you’ve done this step (or how you’re being paid for the summer), please talk to Carly.\nWith summer payments, there is a possibility it may take an extra week or two for your payments to start (but you will eventually get your full pay). If you anticipate this being a problem, please talk to Carly so we can sort something out. Similarly, if you ever notice a problem with your payments over the summer (you didn’t get paid, or your pay seems more or less than it’s supposed to be), talk to Carly and we’ll get it fixed!\n\n\n\n\nHow much do I work?\n\nYour weekly work hours are based on your individual funding situation (e.g. NSERC, CUSRA, MITACS, other lab funding), and your individual arrangement with Carly.\nFor NSERC and CUSRA funding, the official expectation is 16 weeks at 35 hours per week. However, this funding rate is actually below our QC minimum wage. To ensure that you are compensated fairly, and so that you have a chance to recharge over the summer, our lab policy is to encourage all award students to take a week of vacation during the tenure of your award (i.e., work 15 weeks, rather than 16). This can be all at once, or spread out over the summer (see notes on vacation, below)\n\nNote: For NSERC students, don’t forget to apply to the FQRNT supplement (directions in the linked file above, or ask Carly!) - For project students (e.g. BIOL490, LOYC398, SCOL391, etc.), the expectation is ~9 hours per week for a 3-credit load. You should consider this similar to the amount of time you would put into a 300 or 400 level lab course.\n\nFor Mitacs, you can see the FAQ here: https://www.mitacs.ca/en/globalink/globalink-research-internships/faqs\n\nIf you filled out a TRAC NOH form, that form stipulates your number of hours - If in doubt, just ask!\n\n\n\nThere will likely be some flexibility from week to week for all of you, depending how busy your project is, whether you are in the field, etc. If you are expected to work 30 hours per week, for example, there may be some weeks that you only work 25, and others that you work 35. The first few weeks in particular often feel a bit slow as we get things moving, but I promise they’ll speed up when you get into the field!\n\nWhen do I work?\n\nIn terms of your specific weekly schedule, please check in with your project lead(s) to determine what is appropriate. In general, for times when you are working from home or in the lab, I am open to flexible hours (for example, if you’d prefer to work early in the morning and end early, or take some time off in the day and work in the evening, we can discuss that arrangement). However, there may be certain times and tasks that you will need to be available for particular days or hours. This is especially true if you will be doing any work in the field, or in collaboration with other colleagues, as well as for any scheduled meetings. We will discuss this with you in advance. If at any point you anticipate changing your usual days/hours significantly, let someone know so that we know when to expect you to be available.\nIf you are a project student (e.g. working in the lab for course credit), we understand that you may also be working full time throughout the summer. In this case, hours can be more flexible (including evenings/weekends), although there will be some exceptions, for example for fieldwork or for team meetings.\nNote (as per the lab policy): since many of us work at different times, you may receive emails or messages outside of your work hours. Please do not feel obligated to answer these until you are back on “work time”. For example, if you receive a message in the evening, you can wait until the next day to respond. Similarly, you may email me (or your other colleagues in the lab) at any time, but understand that we may not answer until we are working.\n\nHow do I track my work?\n\nSince I don’t always “see” you working for much of the summer, I trust that you’re working the hours that we agreed, and that you can manage your own time well. However, please do make sure that you track your hours! Each of you should keep a log (online, or in a physical notebook) of the hours that you work on each day that you are working.\nRemember to take a break for lunch! A 30 min lunch break is included in your daily hours, and a few short breaks throughout the day are ok, too. So for example, if you work from 10am to 4pm, and take a break for lunch, and a short afternoon break you still log that day as 6 hours. When in the lab or field, students will often stop and eat lunch together. I’d encourage you to meet for lunch with your fellow summer research assistants at least a few times a week if you can, so you don’t miss out on the fun social aspect of being in a lab!\nStatutory holidays count for the equivalent number of daily hours you are expected to work. For example, if you typically work 35 hours per week, you would receive 7 hours off (paid) for a holiday (35/5 work days per week = 7 hours).\n\nWhat if I get sick, or need time off for some other reason?\n\nIf you’re feeling sick, please take a sick day(s). You can always make up the work later, and your wellbeing is a priority. This is always true, but particularly so during the current situation, where we should all be taking very good care of our health. If you are sick please make sure to let someone in the lab know that you’re unwell, so that we don’t worry about you, and can make sure that someone else steps in to cover your tasks if needed.\nIf you have a family emergency, or a similar issue, please take the time you need to deal with it (and let your team lead or Carly know that you need some time away from work).\nIf you are planning a vacation, please talk to your team lead, or to Carly so that we can adjust your hours/payment as needed, and ensure that someone can cover any necessary tasks while you are away.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour day to day contacts will look a little bit different for each of you. Most of you will be working closely with a graduate student(s) or postdoc as the “lead” of your project. In that case, that person will be your first point of contact throughout the summer (they will help direct you in your day to day/week to week activities, help you troubleshoot issues, and are who you should contact first if you have questions about what to work on). Some of you will report directly to Carly, or may be working with different people throughout the summer at various points. In general, our lab is a very collegial work environment, and you should always feel comfortable reaching out to graduate students to brainstorm or ask questions about your work. At our first summer team meeting, we’ll discuss each person’s expertise, but I will also include a broad overview of the major research areas in the lab, here, to help you orient yourself (and remember who’s in the lab, since we’re a big group!)\nYou’ll typically meet with your “lead” regularly throughout the summer (or, you’ll be in the field together!) to check in on progress, and help troubleshoot any issues you’re having. These meetings may become more or less frequent over the summer depending how things are going.\nAll of you will have a “core” project that you are working on, but we encourage undergraduates to get a diversity of experiences while in the lab. This means that I may ask you to contribute to other projects occasionally. This helps to keep all lab projects moving forward, and gives you a chance to gain new skills and experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent lab members are italicized, loosely organized by “theme” for the summer. I’ve indicated incoming lab members in bold (including our new summer undergraduate students, as well as graduate students and postdocs arriving this summer)\nUrban parks fieldwork - Urban forest ecology, soil ecology, and land use legacies: Bella is a PhD student working on the urban forest, and Michael is an MSc student working on urban soils. Both Bella and Michael will conduct fieldwork throughout the summer in a number of Montreal parks. Erica and Gabrielle will be assisting with these projects this summer. At the end of June, this team will be joined by Angelina (a Mitacs intern from Germany), and Laura (a Mitacs intern from Colombia)\n\nErica reports to Bella/Michael for general fieldwork tasks and scheduling, and to Bella (and Carly as needed) for her BIOL490 project\nGabrielle reports to Bella/Michael for general fieldwork, and to Carly for UrbaNature research/questions\nAngelina tentatively reports to Michael for fieldwork tasks and scheduling (to be updated)\nLaura tentatively reports to Bella for fieldwork tasks and scheduling (to be updated)\n\nCo-benefits of nature-based solutions for climate resilience and biodiversity:\nKayleigh is a research associate (and recent MSc graduate) working on biodiversity (especially birds) and ecosystem services of the urban forest, alongside our collaborator Dr. Barbara Frei (who works for Environment and Climate Change Canada). She will be doing primarily literature-based work this summer, but is excellent at tree-ID, and a great resource for learning field techniques. Two new team members will join us to work in this area. Riikka Kinnunen is a new postdoc who will start in July, and incoming MSc student Chloe Cull will arrive in August to begin an MSc with us in September.\n\nSome of our undergraduate team members may help Kayleigh (or others) out with tasks this summer if needed\n\nGreen Infrastructure and ecosystem services (DesignLifes NSERC Create project):\nFatemeh is a PhD student working on walkability through a lens of urban greening and thermal comfort. She is on maternity leave this summer. Lingshan is a PhD student working on the effect of urban greening (including green space structure and quality) on urban microclimates. Both Fatemeh and Lingshan are co-supervised within Concordia’s Next Gen Cities Institute, and are part of other labs in addition to ours. Urban planning undergrad Niraj will continue part time in the lab with his meta-analysis on green roofs. Nicole will join us this August to begin an MSc on green infrastructure in September. - Niraj will continue to report to Carly as team lead\nForest entomology:\nNoa is a PhD student co-advised in the Despland lab working on Spongy Moth outbreaks in peri-urban forests (at Oka and Mont St Bruno). She will likely be joined later this summer by Victoria, a Mitacs intern from Vanier college, as well as summer interns in the Despland lab. Lab undergraduates may have opportunities to help Noa in the field this summer and fall.\nWhat happens in lab meetings?\n\nThis summer, we will not have our usual weekly lab meetings, but will meet for a lab lunch at Loyola campus on the 3rd Friday of each month (May 20, June 17, Jul 15…) to catch up and hear from all of our various teams. We also often have social activities (lab BBQs, etc. throughout the summer to get everyone together). Social activities are always optional, but lots of fun! - For those of you continuing during the academic year, we have a lab meeting each week with the full team (and sometimes some guests from other labs at Concordia or elsewhere). At lab meetings, we usually do a quick check in to see how everyone is doing, and discuss any issues or announcements. Then, we’ll all discuss a paper we’ve read, or a talk that we’ve watched, or discuss a professional development topic (like science communication, how to read a paper, best practices for data entry or analysis, etc.). We will decide the topics in advance together. Preparing for lab meeting (for example, reading papers or watching talks) and attending lab meeting counts as part of your work/study hours. You are expected to attend when you can, but fieldwork or other time-sensitive tasks take priority! - Also during the academic year, the students in the lab run a peer-writing-group, where they review and discuss each-others writing. This can be a great activity to join if you want to improve your writing skills.\n\nWhat do I do if I have some “down time” (e.g. you’re finished what you’re working on, or don’t have a task for the day/week yet… but still want to work or need to fill your hours?)\n\nFirst, reach out to your team lead. If they don’t have any tasks for you, you can reach out to the broader lab on Zulip to ask if anybody needs some extra help that week. There are often tasks that can use an extra set of hands!\n\nIf nobody needs you right away, a really important part of research is developing your reading skills, and familiarizing yourself with the literature. We will set up “reading lists” for several core areas in the lab (for example, here’s a previous list on trees) in the google drive, and will continue to update these with additional material. If you aren’t sure where to start, pick one that looks interesting, or talk to students working in a similar area for a suggestion! There is also a general urban ecology reading list in the drive, if you would like to read more broadly. If you don’t have anything to do, do some reading. Reading will be especially important in the first few days/weeks, since projects may be off to a slow start as we all transition into summer, and it’s important to familiarize yourself with the field you’ll be working in.\n\nSo how do you read a paper? This may seem like a silly question, but reading scientific papers actually takes some practice, especially if you haven’t done much of this in your courses yet. This is always a great discussion for a lab meeting, but here are a few useful articles:\n\nhttps://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/03/how-seriously-read-scientific-paper\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-read-and-understand-a-scientific-paper_b_5501628\n\nDon’t worry if it takes you a long time (like, several hours!) to properly and thoroughly read a scientific paper - that’s totally normal. You should be reading carefully, and taking notes on pieces you don’t understand or you find especially interesting, so that you can follow up later. This is especially true for those of you doing work for credit, or working on a research project\nWe also have a number of textbooks available in the virtual lab library on the Google Drive\nYou can also work a shorter week, and “bank” some hours for a long day in the field later, for example.\n\n\n\nI need something to be able to do my work well\n\nIf you need resources (more storage space on your computer, access to a specific book or article, a borrowed tablet or laptop, etc.) to be able to work effectively, please talk to Carly. We may be able to arrange something through the lab.\n\nI have more questions!\n\nWrite all of your questions down for later. If it’s a general question about the lab or your projects, you can ask in the “undergraduates” stream of the Zulip once you’re set up there. If it’s a question about paperwork/payment/hours, you can ask Carly directly (via Zulip direct message, or an email)\n\nOk, that’s all for now! Your team leads or I will be working on some short “intro” tasks for each of you to get you started. So, you should all have some activities to get started on soon after your work term starts in the lab… For those of you who have already started, you can also start familiarizing yourself with the online tools listed at the top of this document, or dig into a paper from your reading lists! There will be more updates to come as we all settle in.\nWelcome to the team, and looking forward to a fun summer!"
