    "text": "Version 3, 29 June 2007\nCopyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\nThe GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.\nThe licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program–to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\nFor the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users’ and authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\n\n\n\n\n“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.\nTo “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.\nA “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\nTo “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n\n\nThe “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.\nA “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work’s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.\n\n\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.\n\n\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.\n\n\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.\n\n\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:\n\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.\nA “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.\n“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.\n\n\n\n“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.\n\n\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.\n\n\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n\n\nA “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.\nA contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.\nA patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.\n\n\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.\n\n\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\nCopyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n<program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type 'show c' for details.\nThe hypothetical commands show w and show c should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>."

Environ Res Lett. https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac12f2\n\nKeywords: Urban heat island, temperature mitigation, canopy cover\nRelationship between tree canopy and cooling is most likely non-linear, with no benefits experienced until 25-50% cover. Clustering of vegetation is a determinant of how much cooling occurs at the site of examination and surrounding areas. Street trees have a “distributed canopy” that is overtop a hard surface – which makes cooling harder. Used impervious surface, building height, and skyview as built factors. Building shade and canopy cover attributed cooling effects. Impervious surface caused similar amounts of heating. Nighttime was crucial because impervious surfaces re-released heat. Soft canopy cover cooled best, hard canopy cover still cooled but was not found at high % and thus cooled less but was still important in the afternoon. Cooling effect changes in evening because trees provide more shade at the decreased angle of the sun. Impervious surface did not have much of an effect because the areas with highest amount of impervious surface also had tall buildings, which provided cooling through shading."

Environmental Science & Policy 112:254–263. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2020.05.021\n\nKeywords: environmental justice, TNOC, green infrastructure, gentrification\nThe unequal intangible benefits obtainable from urban green spaces can be potential core drivers of social injustice in cities. Gentrification is when neighbourhoods built, retail, and social environments combined with changes in demographic composition that increases socioeconomic residents and displaces vulnerable populations. The greater the amount, size and quality of urban green amenities, the more displacement occurs. Gentrified green spaces had high levels of aesthetic and recreation services, parks that were not gentrified had cultural identity and socialization services. non-gentrified parks have smaller total surface of green area."

There are different approaches to each of the main elements as well as complex interactions linking them. The processes described occur at multiple scales and management levels. The links between nature and benefits to people are strongly scale-dependent and straddle many scales. Intrinsic values are those inherent to nature independent of human judgement (e.g. non-human species’ right to exist) and they have no relationship with possible benefits to humans or their quality of life.

Evidence of inequity can vary by the size of the unit of analysis. Evidence that strength and direction of relationships could vary with the measurement applied. High levels in variation of effect size between studies. When examined alone, there is significant inequity for the Latinx communities and when there are multiple minorities together. Substantial inequity is found on public land. Adding control variables, detrending for spatial autocorrelation, and using larger scales results in less inequity found. There is a large city effect – relationship with population, residential segregation, and local climate."

Integration comes from the idea of “holistic government” which identifies that complex, intertwined problems cannot be solved in isolation. There are three levels of integrated policy making - cooperation (low), coordination (medium), integrated policy making (high). To achieve integrated policy making, you need comprehensiveness, aggregation, and consistency. Environmental policy integration (EPI) is a distinct form of integration because it argues that the environment should be present in ALL policy sectors. In practice, integrated planning initiatives face barriers for implementation. We are currently in second-generation thinking of sustainability - recognizing it as a uniquely interdisciplinary problem at every scale: an integrated approach is necessary.

Cybergeo: European Journal of Geography. https://doi.org/10.4000/cybergeo.28067\n\nKeywords: urban peripheries, urban political ecology, governance, urban metabolism, Montreal\nQuarry opened in St-Michael in ~1890s, transformed into a dump in 1968, closed in 2000. Early research on urbanization in MTL focused on the regional decline - during the economic rise of Toronto and reconfiguration of transportation occurring between 1970-2000. Recently the suburbs have become key to the study of urbanization in MTL. Saint-Michel is a multi-ethnic neighbourhood dominated by Haitian and North African communities and recent migrants. There are linear configurations (city discards without reusing resources) and circular configurations (city reuses discarded materials and resources) within urban metabolism theory. Environmental and socio-spatial trajectories of St-Michel are intertwined and inseparable. Quarrying of limestone and clay was a decisive role in the construction of the MTL agglomeration, especially its center. Quarrying left its mark - with most public parks being built on former excavations, although most of these were small (1-10ha). Quarries in St-Michel were 192 and 94 ha - 42% of the surface of the district. They remained active longer than other quarries and provided grey limestone and cement for the construction of large-scale buildings in the modern city. Miron quarry was converted into MTL’s main dump and Francon quarry was turned into snow dump site - it is still in operation. The snow dump site impacts the neighbourhood through compromising safety and air quality - as well as isolating the district by reducing transport. Saint-Michel’s population boomed following WW2 - it was described as a new suburb, first attracting quarry workers who wanted to be close to their jobs and then immigrants. 75% of current building stock was constructed 1945-60s to meet the demand for housing - the result was poorly planned urbanization where housing was directly adjacent to industrial areas. The creation of an expressway dividing st-michel in half was experienced as a profound upheaval for residents. The result is an isolated, extremely dense population that has to travel further for services - a neighbourhood in the margins experiencing crisis since the 80s. There has been increase in poverty and unemployment - transformed from a working-class neighbourhood to a disadvantaged neighbourhood in the 80s. Average income is ~ $20,000 less than Montreal’s average and 10% of buildings are in disrepair. Extremely important neighbourhood for immigrants. Saint-Michael was annexed to city of MTL in 1968 to try and decrease fragmentation and lead to improved economic (and otherwise) unity. CMM/CUM administration brought together all the cities on hte island of Montreal with the hope of redistributing municipal service costs more equitably - this coincided with reorg of waste management. After annexation, Saint Michel received waste from the entire island of MTL, part of a political strategy to take waste “away from the center”, playing an integral role in development of MTL. Since annexation, it has been part of the “urban renewal project”. Administration bought quarry from Miron company and made the public decision to transform it into a metropolitan park 1994-2001 (called CESM). The CESM is becoming a showcase of environmental waste management through recycling sites and methane capture. The project means to attract people and bolster MTL’s reputation. However, there is a large discrepancy between resident needs/priorities and this project - causing further splintering/fragmentation between htis local space and neighbourhood identity. Saint Michel residents are concerned abut gentrification and lack of consultation. Most educational, recreational, and commercial investments were made in the part of the park that is furthest away from the majority of Saint-Michel residents."

Research on contribution of biodiversity to ES is new. Service providing units (SPUs) are species populations that are the fundamental unit contributing ES at the local level. Ecosystem service providers (ESPs) characterize the functional traits and funcitonal importance of organisms that deliver ES. Combined SPUs and ESPs into service provider concept to make a conceptual framework for biodiversity’s contributions to ES.The framework occurs over various organizational levels – promoting linking the most appropriate organizational level to the service. Give examples from the literature for various levels of organizations – populations of one species, multispecies functional groups, landscapes. Understanding/quantifying precise relationships between provider characteristics and beneficiaries is important for land managers who are trying to decide between trade-offs. Relationships between species and groups (synergistic, antagonistic) must be known to understand ES provision."

Supply and benefit do not scale linearly most of the time. Understanding how decisions will impact the ecological production function AND the socioeconomic utility function of a service requires understanding the whole chain. The method used to generate metrics of benefits has consequences. Understanding how different groups of people benefit and use ES is necessary for making management decisions that prioritize equity/ environmental justice. Changes in ES will affect different people differently based on mediating factors. Most papers valuate ES without actually measuring how much ES is delivered. Rare to disaggregate service benefits based on group and rare to include mediating factors – impossible to meaningfully understand service delivery without these things."

Tree species can vary without varying trait composition. Intraspecific trait variation can rival interspecific trait variation. Higher trophic levels impact the trait composition of plants and vice versa. Trait variation across space varies more within than across communities because of redundancy across communities. Human modification can lead to increased trait variation while simultaneously causing homogenization in highly converted lands. Most plant canopy phenological and chemical traits cannot be measured directly from passive remotely sensed data. Structural traits can be mapped with active remote sensing methods (LiDAR)."

Urban systems that appear stationary at a particular time scale might be non-stationary on a different time scale. Investigating trends in urban systems can reveal how urban ecosystems respond to stressors. Urban ecosystems experience many different cycles that affect the ecosystems – both in their presence and absence. [[legacy effects]] occur from the temporal autocorrelation within and across cities – they are carry-over effects on subsequent events of ecosystems when carrying manifestations of prior events. There are temporal hotspots (urban events happen at a different rate at a specific location compared to similar events at nearby locations) and hot moments (urban events occur more frequently within a particular time period).

Time is just as important as space in ES processes and services. Understanding multiple ES and their synergies, trade-offs, and interactions is crucial. Used ES-bundle approach – ES bundle is mix of positively correlated ES provided in the same place and time. Provision of each service changed significantly over time and mean provision increased for almost every service, cultural ecosystem services showed greatest magnitude of change through time. The most common types of ES bundles and their spatial dstribution changed through time. Spatial distribution of ES bundles was related to biophysical and socioeconomic attributes of the region. At the regional scales, relationships among ES changed through time in type and strength of relationship. Demonstrated that provision of ES and relationships are dynamic through time and space – trajectories through time are not uniform and are related to spatial distribution of environmental, social, and economic characteristics. Relationships between services can shift through time. Show that ES maps change through time and political decisions and local factors interact to shape changes."

General model for tree cover in cities is increasing over time in grassland areas and decreasing over time in forested areas. Used college campus to investigated how urban forest changed over 150 years. College campuses set canopy cover goals and measure ES internally, much like how a municipality manages the urban forest. Used mixed methods – classified and investigated different time segments using archival records, aerial imagery, news clippings, Trustees minutes. Several decades are needed to fully realize ambitious plans to increase the extent of urban forest. Combining tree age classes is important for maintaining consistent canopy cover. Trees, gardens, and landscape design are used to indicate status and wealth – which is why universities are okay with dedicating time and money to canopy cover. Highlight connections to four broad movements: urban parks; City Beautiful; “spaces in between”, and urban sustainablility."

Using today’s socioeconomic statistics to evaluate urban trees ignores the lag time between tree planting and maturation. Current vegetation cover can be predicted by socioeconomic data from several decades prior. There are human and biophysical legacy effects to current tree cover in cities. Bioregional context determines starting conditions of urban forests and their development. Some trees have historical cultural significance in certain time periods and that has a legacy effect due to increased planting during that time period - e.g. widespread planting of Acer trees in Canada due to symbolism. The first urban tree movement in the US started in the 19th century with higher urbanized populations and associated health concerns - still leaves legacies to this day. Canada often used the US as inspiration for tree planting in their cities. Suburban areas expanded in mid-20th century in Canada. Building age often correlates with tree cover in a nonlinear way. Ecological disturbance causes legacy effects."

Legacies of urban form and sociodemographic change also shape UTC patterns. Time lag of tree maturity means that multi-decadal time scales are required to see shifts in UTC. Shifts from urban/agricultural -> suburban have seen increases to UTC but relationship is not always present. It is critical to incorporate historical information. Urbanization/shrinkage/land-use change is not uniform and often has very complex relationships with the history of a place. Looked at specific mechanisms of UTC change. Visually interpreted aerial imagery to assess land cover change. UTC increased most in protected open areas (parks) and most change occurred from switching herbaceous land cover to treed land cover. Open protected areas were also more stable in tree presence. Different planning districts have different changes in UTC but none experienced a loss of UTC. Generally, UTC increases were derived from losses in herbaceous cover, with one planning district experiencing a decrease in building cover. The urban renewal period saw the city expanding into surrounding agricultural land. Urban decline led to disinvestment from municipal parks, leading to urban greening efforts by local NGOs. Also, several large tracts became private/state/federal parks. Former agricultural and rural lands transformed into suburban/industrial landscapes reduced herbaceous cover, increased building/impervious/UTC cover. Municipal parks experienced largest gain of UTC of any classification - also had the most stable UTC with 90% of trees present 40 years ago persisting to today. Divestment in park budgets results in unmaintained parks with unintentional forest emergence - causing increase in UTC. Specific planting initiatives also increased UTC in parks. Land cover transitions were linked across the city. UTC gains occurred across socioeconomic lines but the historical angle is extremely important - high-density neighbourhoods had less space for planting but experienced more UTC gains than neighbourhoods with more space but higher % of black people. Philadelphia did not experience major invasive pests during study time frame."

Street trees provide temperature mitigation outside and within buildings. Decreased temperatures and light during the winter due to trees could be bad for human health. Trees increase surface roughness and the area of the ground surface taht atmospheric pollutants come into contact with - potentially reducing air pollution. Large leaves remove more gaseous pollutants than small ones. Canopies change urban air flow regimes potentially improving air quality. Trees emit VOCs in response to stress and they can contribute to ozone formation but levels are species dependent.

Neighbourhood parks were often much smaller and had less amenities than larger “urban parks”. Men consistently used green spaces more than women, for all demographic user groups. Sports fields dominated green spaces and were underused by women and the elderly. Size of green space was very important for users of urban parks, whereas neighbourhood parks were used for daily life activities like cooking and playing. Safety was primary barrier for using green spaces, especially for women."

None of the current perspectives are enough to ensure sustainability in cities.The landscape ecology approach allows all the previous approaches to be integrated together and could help develop urban sustainability. The metropolitan landscape is arguably the most effective focal level of study for urban sustainability."

LST was derived from ASTER data at a 90-m resolution. GSV was used to create spherical land-cover fractions. 1-m [[land cover]] map with 6 classes was obtained from aerial photos provided by NAIP. Soil and building fractions are positively associated with LST during the day and negatively at night. Spherical fractions explain more variation than planar for LST. Heterogeneity in vertical form results in shading heterogeneity and can significantly effect LST. Daytime models have a better fit than nighttime models. SD of spherical fractions are negatively correlated with LST – denser and heterogeneous urban forms can effectively reduce daytime heat."

Urban ES is a special case because urban areas are so spatially heterogeneity that the wrong data could lead to high mapping error. All models underestimated carbon storage – correlations varied across urbanization levels. Overall, LUC models had different spatial distributions of C storage than what was actually observed and this effect increases with increased landscape htereogeneity. Coarse-scale LUC data performed worse than fine-scale LUC data."

Show how the framework of spatial heterogeneity in ecology of cities (as opposed to ecology in cities) supports more effective measurement, improves management, and relates better to design. Heterogeneity results from various processes – ecological, built infrastructure, land use types, etc. Spatial heterogeneity is crucial to urban sustainability. Diagram comparing ecology in and of cities and appraches to spatial heterogeneity. Ecology in cities doesn’t take into account social attributes with the exception of occasional, coarse scale parameters. Ecology in cities often maps land use types as discrete pixels at low resolutions – this may not accurately capture spatial heterogeneity of urban systems, need to shift the paradigm. Ecology of cities describes spatial heterogeneity using hybrid compositional elements. Hybridity reflects patch structure from biophysical and social-economic sources. Use the patch mosaic model for modellign spatial heterogeneity using ecology of cities. Increasing spatial and conceptual resolution CAN go together but they are separate concepts. Ecology of cities provides a more holistic view of the city landscape for management. Urban design parallels the ecology of cities framework – recognizing that every patch has value."

Forest studies on biodiversity-ecosystem function have ignored landscape structure. Measured connectivity using frag-stats. Large managed forest fragments had highest C stocks. Species richness was highest in connected, unamanaged fragments and lowest in connected, managed fragments. Functional dispersion lowest in large, managed fragments. Functional diversity was a significant predictor of C stocks. Biodiversity conservation can lead to increased quantities of C stored at the landscape scale. Increasing connectivity may strengthen the synergy between biodiversity and C."

Three conditions where land-use legacies are especially important for understanding current ES supply: intrinsically slow ecological processes govern ES supply, time lags between land-use change and ecosystem responses delay the effects on ES supply, threshold relationships exist so that changes in ES may be difficult to reverse. Soil ES, environmental pollutants are example of slow ecological processes governing ES. Time lag effects can be especially pronounced for biodiversity-based services (e.g. exinction debts) and hydrologic services. Studies have not yet addressed thresholds and reversibility related to land-use legacies. Hydrologic ES, soil P levels, flood mitigation are examples of ES that experience historical thresholds and legacy lock-ins. Long-term consequences of new contaminants may provide unaticipated challenges for future ES supply (e.g. microplastics)"

Land cover based proxies are poor tool for measuring ES – cities are too heterogeneous. Need to understand which ES indicators vary among and within land-cover classes. Historical land-use affects ecosystem functions for decades to millennia. ES related to soil may be particularly sensitive to temporal impacts. Measured soil characteristics on previously agricultural land to see legacy effect on C storage, water quality, and runoff. Soil C varied with time since development but relationship differed among land cover classes and with depth. Soil properties varied with time since development, indicating that land-use legacies can influence current urban ES. There were differences among land cover classes in the spatial scales at which variance in soil properties was most pronounced – most likely due to management."
